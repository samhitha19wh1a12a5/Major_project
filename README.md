LUNG CANCER DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

As per the technical evolution and latest trend taken into consideration, Lung cancer is one of the 
most common and deadly cancers worldwide which can be cured only if it is discovered at an early 
stage. Lung cancer can be diagnosed using various technologies, including MRI, isotopes, X-rays, 
and CT. One of the most effective ways to fight cancer is to discover it early enough to significantly 
improve the patient's chances of survival which can be done by the means of Artificial Intelligence. 
The proposed approach uses past medical records to determine if the patient has lung cancer. The 
CT scans are analyzed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to determine the stage of 
cancer. Image quality and accuracy is the core factors of this research, The segmentation and 
enhancement procedure is used to obtain the feature extraction of normal and ab- normal image.
Finally, the suggested model would forecast the patient's estimated medical insurance costs.
Machine learning (ML) approach will be used to train and test the models by utilizing open-source 
datasets.
